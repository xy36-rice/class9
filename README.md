1. Write the null and alternative hypotheses you would use to test each of the following situations:
- Is a coin fair?
- Only about 20% of people who try to quit smoking succeed. Sellers of a motivational tape claim that listening to the recorded messages can help people quit.
- In the 1950s only about 40% of high school graduates went on to college. Has this percentage changed?
- We field test a new type of pipette, planning to market it only if we are sure that at least 60% of people like the new version.

2. A survey investigating whether the proportion of today’s high school seniors who own their own cars is higher than it was a decade ago finds a p-value of 0.017. Is it reasonable to conclude that more high schoolers have cars? Explain.

3. A medical researcher tested a new treatment for poison ivy against the traditional ointment. With a p-value of 0.047 she concludes the new treatment is more effective. What does the p-value mean in this context?

4. Have harsher penalties and ad campaigns increased seatbelt use? Observations of commuter traffic failed to find evidence of a significant change compared with three years ago. What does the study’s p-value of 0.17 means in this context?

5. Researcher developing scanners to search for hidden weapons at airports concluded that a new device is significantly better than the current scanner. They made this decision based on a test using alpha = 0.05. Would they have made the same decision at alpha = 0.10 or alpha = 0.01? Explain

6. Environmentalists concerned about the impact of high-frequency radio transmissions on birds found that there was no evidence of a higher mortality rate among hatchlings in nests near cell towers. They based this conclusion on a test using alpha = 0.05. Would they have made the same decision at alpha = 0.10? How about alpha = 0.01? Explain.

7. A clean air standard requires that vehicle exhaust emissions not exceed specified limits for various pollutants. Many states require that cars be tested annually to make sure they meet the standards. Suppose state regulators double check a random sample of cars that a suspect repair shop has certified as okay. They will revoke the shop’s license if they find significant evidence that the shop is certifying vehicles that do not meet standards. 	
- In this context, what is a Type I error?
- In this context, what is a Type II error?
- Which type of error would the shop’s owner consider more serious?
- Which type of error might environmentalists consider more serious?
